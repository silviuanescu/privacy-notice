      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">Last updated: November 07, 2025</p>
      <p>MiaLoo (the “App”) is developed and published by <strong>Marian-Silviu Anescu</strong>. This privacy policy explains how the App handles user and device data.</p>
      <div class="card"><strong>Summary:</strong> The App does not collect, store, or share personal data; it contains no advertising and uses Google Play Billing solely to process an optional paid subscription for access. The App is intended for very young children (ages 0–3) and is designed to operate safely offline.</div>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>1. No Personal Data Collected</h2>
      <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal information. We do not request or process names, email addresses, phone numbers, precise location, contacts, photos, or any other identifiers. Account creation is not required.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. No Third‑Party Advertising</h2>
      <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> display advertisements and does not include any third‑party advertising SDKs.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
      <p>The App does not use analytics or tracking technologies (for example, no Firebase/Google Analytics, attribution SDKs, cookies, or similar).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>The App is designed for young children (ages 0–3). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. We aim to comply with applicable children’s privacy laws, including the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), where relevant.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Permissions and Device Access</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Microphone/Camera:</strong> Not requested or used. The App does not record audio or video.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Used only for local assets required for the App to function (e.g., images and sounds).</li>
        <li><strong>Network:</strong> May be used to verify an active subscription with Google Play and to check license/entitlement. The App works offline once this check has been completed.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensitive data:</strong> The App does not access contacts, messages, call logs, calendar, or precise location.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Subscription &amp; Payments</h2>
      <p>The App offers a monthly subscription (“<code>premium_monthly</code>”) to unlock full access to content. All payments are processed <strong>exclusively</strong> through Google Play Billing. We do not receive, store, or have access to credit‑card or payment details.</p>
      <p>You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time through your Google Play account settings. For information about how Google handles data, please review the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
      <p>Because we do not collect personal data, there is no personal data stored on our servers. Local assets within the App are read‑only and contain no user content.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. International Use</h2>
      <p>The App may be made available in multiple countries and languages. Regardless of location, we do not collect personal data and we rely on Google Play Billing to process payments.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available at this URL, and the “Last updated” date at the top will reflect the most recent changes.</p>
