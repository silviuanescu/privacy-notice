      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">Last updated: December 06, 2025</p>
      <p><strong>MiaLoo</strong> (the “App”) is developed and published by <strong>Marian-Silviu Anescu</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles user and device data.</p>
      
      <div class="card">
        <strong>Summary:</strong>  
        MiaLoo does not collect, store, or share personal data.  
        The App contains no advertising.  
        Purchases (if available) are processed entirely through the platform used (Google Play or Apple App Store).  
        The App is designed for very young children (ages 1–5) and functions safely offline.
      </div>

    <section>
      <h2>1. No Personal Data Collected</h2>
      <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal information. We do not request or process names, email addresses, phone numbers, precise location, contacts, photos, or any other identifiers. Account creation is not required.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. No Third-Party Advertising</h2>
      <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> display advertisements and does not include any third-party advertising SDKs.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
      <p>The App does not use analytics or tracking technologies. This includes (but is not limited to) Firebase/Google Analytics, attribution SDKs, cookies, usage profiling, or behavioral tracking tools.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>The App is intended for very young children (ages 0–3). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. We design the App to comply with applicable child-safety and privacy laws, including the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), where relevant.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Permissions and Device Access</h2>
      <p>Permissions used by the App may vary slightly between Android and iOS platforms. In all cases, MiaLoo does <strong>not</strong> access sensitive user data.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Microphone / Camera:</strong> Not requested or used. The App does not record audio or video.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Used only to load local, read-only assets required for the App to function (images, sounds, animations). The App does not access personal files.</li>
        <li><strong>Network:</strong> May be used solely to verify an active purchase/subscription or entitlement via Google Play or the App Store. Once verified, the App works offline.</li>
        <li><strong>No Sensitive Data Access:</strong> The App does not access contacts, messages, call logs, calendars, health data, or precise location.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Purchases &amp; Payments</h2>
      <p>If the App offers in-app purchases or subscriptions, all payments are processed <strong>exclusively</strong> through the official store platform used by the user:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Play Billing</strong> (Android users)</li>
        <li><strong>Apple App Store In-App Purchases</strong> (iOS users)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not receive, store, or have access to any credit-card, banking, or payment information. All billing details are handled by Google or Apple.</p>
      <p>You can manage or cancel purchases or subscriptions through your Google Play or App Store account settings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
      <p>Because we do not collect or store personal data, no personal information exists on our servers. Local files used by the App are read-only and contain no user-generated content.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. International Use</h2>
      <p>The App may be available in multiple languages and regions. Regardless of the user’s country, MiaLoo does not collect personal information and relies on the app store platform for payments.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
